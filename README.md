# General Info
## Project Introduction
### The purpose and goals of building the project idea
- The purpose of my small project is to clarify one of the problems that may affect any child at this time, and this problem is dyslexia.
- The first goal is to reach, touch, and embrace each child through reading. Reading is the best way to communicate with children.
- The second goal is to give a vivid and tangible example of the famous writer Camilla Narng, who was able to become a writer of fictional 
stories for children and communicate with them through her books despite the dyslexia that she suffered from when his child 
was in school, but she is one of the many famous characters who was able To prove that with will and challenge it is possible 
to reach the highest positions.

- The third goal of building the Maxi and Helium Project was that I wanted to communicate with each child and try to help them. 
As these two mice wanted to deliver a message to the children, which is that no matter what difficulties and problems you face, 
try to solve and discuss them with your family and brothers, and always be stronger, so life is worth fighting and struggling.

# Scope
This is my first project and its goal is to learn and creating a responsive website, that is mobile first.
As for my project,I built a website that contains seven different pages and used many languages and technologies in it, which I will release later.
The project is based on four main pages, which are the Home page, Book page, Author page, and finally Contact page which Allow us to communicate with our readers or visitors.
I have tested my project through the responsivedesign and this was the result

# UserExperience 
## User stories
-  First-time visitor goals
    1. Building an integrated and simple website for easy navigate between its sections, which suits children, as the content is suitable for young age groups between 3 and 12 years old.
    2. As a first time visitor, I would like to see a meaningful and useful site, to which parents and children would love to return.
    
- Returning Visitor Goals
    1. The user will come back several times to benefit from the targeted educational content.
    2. To register for our newsletter to stay informed of any current new changes.
    3. The user can make any comments that the owner can use to update the existing data or add new data that the reader can benefit from it.

## Design
### Colour Scheme
 - I used a group of colors between brown to beige, derived from nature, earth, and trees /nature's colors suggest psychological 
comfort for the visitor, which makes him want to come constantly.
- I used the project colors with the help of  [COLOR TOOL](https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=1&view.right=0&secondary.color=6A1B9A&primary.color=4E342E)


### Typography
- Roboto font is the main font used throughout the entire website with Sans Serif as the backup font in case the font has not been 
imported properly to the site for any reason. I have used two other fonts *Indie Flowe* and *Inknut Antiqua* to beautify and design the pages and attract children without feeling bored 
by using one type of font in the whole project.All the fonts I used on the pages are clean fonts that are used frequently in programming, 
so it is attractive and appropriate.
- The source for the inspired fonts is [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

### Imagery
Imagery is important. All the images were obtained by Google Researcher, which is for the Maxi and Helium story books, 
which are present on all pages of the project and for the home page I used A slideshow component for cycling through elementsâ€”images by using Bootstrap 4 and the idea was the developer idea by getting help from the example bellow code

                      div id="carouselExampleFade" class="carousel slide carousel-fade" data-bs-ride="carousel" data-bs-pause="hover"  data-interval="10000" 
and I have used this website [Unspalsh.com](www.unsplash.com)  and have chosen a background Image in my Contact page.

   as it helps a lot and makes many things easy for any programmer or developer to forget any code and this 
   is with regard to the features and components of **Html5** and **Css3**
