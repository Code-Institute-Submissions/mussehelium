# General Info
## Project Introduction
### The purpose and goals of building the project idea
- The purpose of my small project is to clarify one of the problems that may affect any child at this time, and this problem is dyslexia.
- The first goal is to reach, touch, and embrace each child through reading. Reading is the best way to communicate with children.
- The second goal is to give a vivid and tangible example of the famous writer Camilla Narng, who was able to become a writer of fictional 
stories for children and communicate with them through her books despite the dyslexia that she suffered from when his child 
was in school, but she is one of the many famous characters who was able To prove that with will and challenge it is possible 
to reach the highest positions.

- The third goal of building the Maxi and Helium Project was that I wanted to communicate with each child and try to help them. 
As these two mice wanted to deliver a message to the children, which is that no matter what difficulties and problems you face, 
try to solve and discuss them with your family and brothers, and always be stronger, so life is worth fighting and struggling.

# User Experience 
## User stories
-  First-time visitor goals
   1. Building an integrated and simple website for easy navigate between its sections, which suits children, as the content is suitable for young age groups between 3 and 12 years old.
   2. As a first time visitor, I would like to see a meaningful and useful site, to which parents and children would love to return.
    
- Returning Visitor Goals
  1. The user will come back several times to benefit from the targeted educational content.
  2. To contact with us to stay informed of any current new changes.
  3. The user can make any comments that the owner can use to update the existing data or add new data that the reader can benefit from it.

- Frequent User Goals
  1. I want to check to see if there are any newly books added. 
  2. I want to benefit more from reading books and learning lessons from them.


## Design
### Colour Scheme
 - I used a group of colors between brown to beige, derived from nature, earth, and trees /nature's colors suggest psychological 
comfort for the visitor, which makes him want to come constantly.
- I used the project colors with the help of  [COLOR TOOL](https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=1&view.right=0&secondary.color=6A1B9A&primary.color=4E342E)


### Typography
- Roboto font is the main font used throughout the entire website with Sans Serif as the backup font in case the font has not been 
imported properly to the site for any reason. I have used two other fonts *Indie Flowe* and *Inknut Antiqua* to beautify and design the pages and attract children without feeling bored 
by using one type of font in the whole project.All the fonts I used on the pages are clean fonts that are used frequently in programming, 
so it is attractive and appropriate.
- The source for the inspired fonts is [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

### Imagery
Imagery is important. All the images were obtained by Google Researcher, which is for the Maxi and Helium story books, 
which are present on all pages of the project and for the home page I used A slideshow component for cycling through elementsâ€”images by using Bootstrap 4 and the idea was the developer idea by getting help from the example bellow code,
and I used this website [Unsplash.com](www.unsplash.com) and chosen a background Image for my Contact page.

                      div id="carouselExampleFade" class="carousel slide carousel-fade" data-bs-ride="carousel" data-bs-pause="hover"  data-interval="10000"

## Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section
### Visitor Goals
First time visitor, he can understand the main purpose of this site by looking at the books first and secondly through the link on the books page, which he can click and open a file for him on a new page that contains all the information and what are the benefits of reading for children.

Can easily navicate between pages through the Navbar Menu in the Header and he/she can easily move between the books placed on the home page through the book link and also on the books page by clicking on the book's picture.

The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.

The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate the conatat information about the author, links between pages and social media links in the footer.

The Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin, Twitter Pages can be found at the footer of every page and every one will open a new tab for the user 
and more information can be found on the Social pages.

The Youtube page can be found at the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user 
and can find many videos about stories and the author Camilla Briinck, and he can also enjoy audio stories.


## Further Testing
The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

## Known Bugs
On some mobile devices the carousel Images pushes the size of screen out more than any of the other content on the page sometimes.
A white gap can be seen to the right of the footer and navigation bar as a result.
