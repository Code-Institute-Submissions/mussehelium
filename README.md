# General Info
## Project Introduction
### The purpose and goal of building the project idea
-                 The purpose of my small project is to show one of the problems that may affect any child at this time ...

-                 The first goal is to reach every child, touch him and cuddle him through reading ... through reading, 
                  communication with children becomes easier and enjoyable, and it is possible through it to present and discuss any 
                  possible problem facing the child and try to reach a solution to make everyone happy.
-                 The second goal is to give a vivid and tangible example, which is the famous writer Camilla, 
                  who was able to communicate with all children by writing children's fictional stories, despite what she was facing when 
                  she was younger than the problem of reading and writing, but with her strong will she was able to become one of the most 
                  famous works in Sweden.
-                 The third goal of building the Musa and Helium project is that I tried to talk to every child and try to help him through 
                  these two mice and try to deliver a message to all members of the community, including parents and children.

# Scope
This is my first project and its goal is to learn and creating a responsive website, that is mobile first.
As for my project,I built a website that contains seven different pages and used many languages and technologies in it, which I will release later.
The project is based on four main pages, which are the Home page, Book page, Author page, and finally Contact page which Allow us to communicate with our readers or visitors.



# UserExperience 
  ## User stories

       - First-time visitor goals
          1. Building an integrated and simple website for easy navigate between its sections, which suits children, as the content is suitable for young age groups between 3 and 12 years old.
          2. As a first time visitor, I would like to see a meaningful and useful site, to which parents and children would love to return.
    
       - Returning Visitor Goals
          1. The user will come back several times to benefit from the targeted educational content.
          2. To register for our newsletter to stay informed of any current new changes.
          3. The user can make any comments that the owner can use to update the existing data or add new data that the reader can benefit from it.

  ## Design
### Colour Scheme
 - I used a group of colors between brown to beige, derived from nature, earth, and trees /nature's colors suggest psychological 
comfort for the visitor, which makes him want to come constantly.
- I used the project colors with the help of  [COLOR TOOL](https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=1&view.right=0&secondary.color=6A1B9A&primary.color=4E342E)


### Typography
- Roboto font is the main font used throughout the entire website with Sans Serif as the backup font in case the font has not been 
imported properly to the site for any reason. I have used two other fonts *Indie Flowe* and *Inknut Antiqua* to beautify and design the pages and attract children without feeling bored 
by using one type of font in the whole project.All the fonts I used on the pages are clean fonts that are used frequently in programming, 
so it is attractive and appropriate.
- The source for the inspired fonts is [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

### Imagery
Imagery is important. All the images were obtained by Google Researcher, which is for the Maxi and Helium story books, 
which are present on all pages of the project and for the home page I used A slideshow component for cycling through elementsâ€”images by using Bootstrap 4 and the idea was the developer idea by getting help from the example bellow code

                      div id="carouselExampleFade" class="carousel slide carousel-fade" data-bs-ride="carousel" data-bs-pause="hover"  data-interval="10000"
