# General Info
## Project Introduction
### The purpose and goal of building the project idea
- The purpose of my small project is to show one of the problems that may affect any child at this time ...

- The first goal is to reach every child, touch him and cuddle him through reading ... through reading, communication with children becomes easier and enjoyable, and it is possible through it to present and discuss any possible problem facing the child and try to reach a solution to make everyone happy.
- The second goal is to give a vivid and tangible example, which is the famous writer Camilla, who was able to communicate with all children by writing children's fictional stories, despite what she was facing when she was younger than the problem of reading and writing, but with her strong will she was able to become one of the most famous works in Sweden.
- The third goal of building the Musa and Helium project is that I tried to talk to every child and try to help him through these two mice and try to deliver a message to all members of the community, including parents and children.
