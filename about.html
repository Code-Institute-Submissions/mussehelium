        create for children, Camilla thinks is one of the best things you can do. She looks forward to writing more books and audiobooks adventures that as many children as possible will be able to enjoy.</p>

        <h2 class="author-public">Author Camilla Brinck never thought she could become a writer, Why?<span class="bio-bio"></span></h2>
        <p>Because she has dyslexia.</p>
        <p><strong>Is dyslexia a difficulty for you?</strong></p>
        <p>- Not today, but it was when I was younger and went to school. I had difficulty both spelling and reading.I read almost half as slowly as my classmates. It simply took longer for me. The letters jumped and I easily lost which line I had just read.<br>
           - But I practiced and practiced reading and writing and what you practice you get better at.            
           Today, my dyslexia is a gift. I would not be able to write Mickey & Helium's books the way I do without dyslexia. Due to my dyslexia, I am very careful that the text flows smoothly and nicely.If it does, it's easier for me to read. Therefore, I am very careful that sentences are not cut in strange 
           places or commas appear unnecessarily and stop the nice flow I want. This has proven to be helpful for other children and adults who usually have difficulty reading books. I get a lot of nice feedback from parents who tell me how their children have now become bookworms. Even children get in touch and tell the same thing. That if something warms to hear, 
           because we should all have access to dive into the world of books, it is fantastic.</p>     
     
  </li>

  <li>
        <h2 class="author-public">Hur kom du på idén för Maxi Mouse and Helium?<span class="bio-bio"></span></h2>
        <p>- I never planned to become a writer, it just happened. From the day Maxi and Helium moved into my life,I felt that my mission is to convey their stories and adventures to as many children and adults as possible.Maxi and Helium are incredibly fun to hang out with, I want you to take part in their lives and history.<br>
          - In that way, I was almost forced to become a writer. I'm very happy that it happened because I probably never came up with the idea myself. I have dyslexia and thought it was impossible for me to work as a writer.</p>
       
  </li>

   <li>
        <h2 class="author-public">Camilla Brinck <span class="bio-bio"> "Maxi and Helium have things they want to tell your children and it will obviously happen through me"</span></h2>     
      <p>“I have a dream of creating a slightly better world. A world where we humans care more about each other. A world where we value qualities and actions such as helpfulness, respect, kindness, generosity, courage, appreciation, understanding for each other and civil courage.Civil courage may sound like a complicated word, but it is about daring to stand up for what you believe in, and to stand up for others - like saying no when someone is bullied. To me, these are the cornerstones of a good person. If we strive to be good every day, our world will become a better, more beautiful and more loving place to live.
The good thing is that you and I can be involved and influence, by trying to be the best person we can be. This does not mean that you should tie yourself to make others happy and forget yourself. But when you feel good, then you can also help others.But sometimes when you feel bad, it can actually feel good to let go of the focus on your own problem for a while and be a support to someone else. If you help someone, you get love and strength back. That feeling is unbeatable every time.
Maxi and Helium work daily to try to be as good mice as they can. Sometimes it goes well and sometimes less well, just like for all of us. It's not about being perfect, it's about doing the best you can.
So now to a secret. These books contain many secret and good messages, where you as a reader will have to think about what you think is right and wrong, think about what you feel and how you would have acted in different situations. So you will not only be drawn into a magical and exciting fairytale world - you will at the same time learn things without even thinking about it, such as self-esteem, courage, helpfulness, creativity and trusting your gut feeling - just to name a few .
Maxi and Helium wish you all the best and are more than happy to share their mistakes and thoughts so that you can learn from them. One of the most important things they have learned and want you to take with you is: If you feel bad about something, talk to someone about it. It always feels better then, and there is help to be had.
Together we are strong and you are fantastic. Always remember that! ”</p>
